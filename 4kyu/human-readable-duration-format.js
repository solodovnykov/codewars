// Your task in order to complete this Kata is to write a function which formats a duration, given as a number of seconds, in a human-friendly way.

// The function must accept a non-negative integer. If it is zero, it just returns "now". Otherwise, the duration is expressed as a combination of years, days, hours, minutes and seconds.

// It is much easier to understand with an example:

// * For seconds = 62, your function should return
//     "1 minute and 2 seconds"
// * For seconds = 3662, your function should return
//     "1 hour, 1 minute and 2 seconds"
// For the purpose of this Kata, a year is 365 days and a day is 24 hours.

// My Solution
const formatDuration = (seconds) => {
  const time = {
    year: 31536000,
    day: 86400,
    hour: 3600,
    minute: 60,
    second: 1,
  };
  let res = [];

  if (seconds === 0) return "now";

  for (let key in time) {
    if (seconds >= time[key]) {
      var val = Math.floor(seconds / time[key]);
      res.push((val += val > 1 ? " " + key + "s" : " " + key));
      seconds = seconds % time[key];
    }
  }

  return res.length > 1
    ? res.join(", ").replace(/,([^,]*)$/, " and" + "$1")
    : res[0];
};
