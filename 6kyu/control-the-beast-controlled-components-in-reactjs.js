// In this kata you'll learn how to control Components with different kinds of beasts. Your goal is to tame and control a beast by building a controlled React component with the following criteria:

// Create a component called Beast and its state name
// The beast to control can be passed as a prop name
// Render a textinput field with the id controlledName. Its value should be the name of the current beast.
// Whenever this field's value is modified, the state should be updated as well
// You should control the beast Yeti if name is not passed in

const React = require("react");

class Beast extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { name: props.name };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <input
        id="controlledName"
        value={this.state.name}
        onChange={(e) => this.setState({ name: e.target.value })}
      />
    );
  }
}

Beast.defaultProps = {
  name: "Yeti",
};
