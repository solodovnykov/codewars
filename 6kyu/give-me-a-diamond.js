// Jamie is a programmer, and James' girlfriend. She likes diamonds, and wants a diamond string from James. Since James doesn't know how to make this happen, he needs your help.

// Task
// You need to return a string that looks like a diamond shape when printed on the screen, using asterisk (*) characters. Trailing spaces should be removed, and every line must be terminated with a newline character (\n).

// Return null/nil/None/... if the input is an even number or negative, as it is not possible to print a diamond of even or negative size.

// Examples
// A size 3 diamond:

//  *
// ***
//  *
// ...which would appear as a string of " *\n***\n *\n"

// My Solution
const diamond = (n) => {
  if (n <= 0 || n % 2 == 0) {
    return null;
  }

  var middle = parseInt((n + 1) / 2);
  var j,
    diam = "";
  for (var i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    j = i <= middle ? i : n - i + 1;
    diam += " ".repeat(middle - j) + "*".repeat(2 * j - 1) + "\n";
  }
  return diam;
};
